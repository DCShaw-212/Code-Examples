    <p class = "sweetborder">
            CIS 270 has given me a greater appreciation for web building. I love writing any kind
        of code, so it was nice to just relax with some intelliJ and repeatedly write/debug. Styling
        the html with css went well for me. It was very straight forward once classes/ids were used and the pages
        were linked correctly. JavaScript wasn't so bad either, but getting the submit button to send
        data to another form can be tricky. <br><br>If I had to do it all over again, I would do things slower.
        I tend to try writing the entire program at once, instead (if you're a new student), you should
        make sure each piece of the code works before moving onto the next problem.
